# Intro


This is a repo with files to create a simple react todolist app.

All of the functionality is included in `App.jsx`


## Exercise 1 - Opening a codespace

Create a codespace of this repository by clicking "code" on the main repository page, then selecting the codespaces tab and clicking "Create a codespace on main".

Open `App.jsx` and have a look through the code. It maybe useful to compare the code in the repository [Codespaces_JS_Example](https://github.com/skamper1/Codespaces_JS_Example/blob/main/TodoList.js) to see how the this differs from vanilla javascript.

## Exercise 2 - install and run

You can install the packages required and run the app from the terminal (Terminal -> open or "ctrl + '") 

You will first need to move into the child directory `todo-list` with the command:

```
cd todo-list
```

The install command is:

```
npm install
```

You can then run the app and see live updates to your code by running the command:

```
npm run dev
```
